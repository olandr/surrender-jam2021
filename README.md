Small game during the annual "Surrender Jam 2021" made with Node. The theme was "Pyromancy" over 48hs 14-6 May 2021. Inspired by BoI as well as any rouge like level progression with a techtree. The goal is to extinguish the fire by getting "-1p". Unfortunately, you will need to burn some bridges to get to that point...

### Features:
* Tech tree with graph-like dependencies defined with four main modification areas:
  * hidden: alterations to the rules of games
  * presentable: key-input rule modifiers, key-listners, a hotline and some DDR.
  * tech: cheaper tech modifiers such as donken-deals or a pretty rough markup.
  * bank: riksbanken gets the interest down low.

* Cool emojis
* A fountain
* Some nice memes
* Readily extensible
* Graph structures
